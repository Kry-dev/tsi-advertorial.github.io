            <p><b>Hi again! I’m Joe, and I’m 62 years old!</b> After becoming a parent 35 years ago, my biggest wish was
              to
              become a grandparent.</p>
            
            <p>I’m blessed with two grandsons and I love spending each living moment with them. They come around every
              weekend for dinner. What they love most is when I take them on a long drive with my Cadillac deVille!</p>
            
            <p>They love it, and it melts my heart to see them happy and smiling.</p>
            
            <p>Although I love talking about my grandsons, this story is not about them; it’s about how an <b>easy-to-follow
              and DMV-approved Mature Driving Course made driving a much safer activity for me and my grandsons.</b></p>
            
            <p><b>Some admit it, and some don’t, but after you pass the age of 55 your reflexes slow down a bit.</b> To be
              honest, I don’t want to admit it either. But safely driving my grandkids around is much more important to me
              than my ego.</p>

            <p>For example, a younger me would slam the brakes instantly if the car in front of me would stop
              unexpectedly, but I’m not so sure about the 62-year-old version of me.</p>
            
            <p>Although it hurts my ego, my feelings, and every cell in my body, I have to admit it: <b>the older you get,
              the slower your reflexes get, and it’s less safe to drive.</b></p>
            
            <p>Now, this isn’t a story about replacing driving with walking… I would never do that unless it’s absolutely
              necessary. That being said…</p>
            
            <p>Driving after a certain age is also one of those things that’s hard to talk about with your children. <b>They wanted me to stop driving for 2 years, but I didn’t. I didn’t want to give up my independence and freedom,

            <p>An ad popped up. I normally hate ads. But this was different.</p>
            
            <p>It was an ad from the <b>Traffic Safety Institute about a DMV Mature Driver Course, here in California.</b>
            </p>
            
            <p>I was skeptical and hesitant after all the disappointments but I clicked on it anyway.</p>
            
            <p><b>And I’m glad I did!</b></p>
            
            <p>To my biggest surprise, this course was <b>free to start</b>, and it was putting money back into your pocket
              because your car insurance will go down after completing it.</p>
            
            <p>I didn’t even take into account saving money before searching for mature driver courses, but this was quite
              an incentive.</p>

                <div class="testimonials-text">My car insurance rates went up recently (through no fault of my own!) and I
                  was looking for ways to reduce what I pay. I was already getting most of my company’s discounts, but I
                  noticed one called Mature Driver Improvement Course discount that I wasn’t getting and didn’t know
                  anything about. I looked it up online and saw that almost all California car insurance companies will
                  give a 5-15% discount for drivers over 55 who take an authorized improvement course. I signed up for the
                  course from the Best Online Traffic School which I completed on my own time over the last few days. The
                  cost of the course was only $19.99, and now I’m eligible for a car insurance discount for the next 3
                  years. It’s an easy way to save money on car insurance!

            <p>It's weird how naive we can be to think that our problems are so unique... just to find out that the
              solution already has <b>more than 6,000 reviews!</b></p>
            
            <p><b>That was when it clicked for me.</b></p>

                <div class="testimonials-text">My car insurance rates went up recently (through no fault of my own!) and I
                  was looking for ways to reduce what I pay. I was already getting most of my company’s discounts, but I
                  noticed one called Mature Driver Improvement Course discount that I wasn’t getting and didn’t know
                  anything about. I looked it up online and saw that almost all California car insurance companies will
                  give a 5-15% discount for drivers over 55 who take an authorized improvement course. I signed up for the
                  course from the Best Online Traffic School which I completed on my own time over the last few days. The
                  cost of the course was only $19.99, and now I’m eligible for a car insurance discount for the next 3
                  years. It’s an easy way to save money on car insurance!
