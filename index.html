          <p><b>Hi again! I’m Joe, and I’m 62 years old!</b> After becoming a parent 35 years ago, my biggest wish was to
            become a grandparent.</p>
          
          <p>I’m blessed with two grandsons and I love spending each living moment with them. They come around every
            weekend for dinner. What they love most is when I take them on a long drive with my Cadillac deVille!</p>
          
          <p>They love it, and it melts my heart to see them happy and smiling.</p>
          
          <p>Although I love talking about my grandsons, this story is not about them; it’s about how an easy-to-follow
            and DMV-approved Mature Driving Course made driving a much safer activity for me and my grandsons.</p>
          
          <p>Some admit it, and some don’t, but after you pass the age of 55 your reflexes slow down a bit. To be
            honest, I don’t want to admit it either. But safely driving my grandkids around is much more important to me
            than my ego.</p>

          <p>For example, a younger me would slam the brakes instantly if the car in front of me would stop unexpectedly, but I’m not so sure about the 62-year-old version of me.</p>
  
          <p>Although it hurts my ego, my feelings, and every cell in my body, I have to admit it: the older you get, <b>the slower your reflexes get, and it’s less safe to drive.</b></p>
  
          <p>Now, this isn’t a story about replacing driving with walking… I would never do that unless it’s absolutely necessary. That being said…</p>
  
          <p>Driving after a certain age is also one of those things that’s hard to talk about with your children.<b>They wanted me to stop driving for 2 years, but I didn’t. I didn’t want to give up my independence and freedom, but I didn’t want to make roads less safe than they already are...</b></p>

          <p>Yes, I’m talking about accidents. I know you think it will never happen to you until it does. That's when you'd give all the money in the world to make things right... and most times, it's too late.</p>
  
          <p>I’m the type of guy who likes to prevent things rather than treat them, and I hope you are as well.</p>
  
          <p>I started searching for solutions online and I was bombarded with all kinds of quick fixes:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><b>YouTube gurus</b> sharing their shady and unsafe driving techniques for
              seniors.</li>
            <li><b>Blogs</b> that sustain untrue facts like nothing changes as you get older and that you’re safe to drive just as you are.</li>
            <li><b>Silly, untested supplements</b> that claim to improve your driving performance overnight.</li>
          </ul>
  
          <p>To be honest, I was disappointed and frustrated with the results I got.</p>

        <h3>The unexpected easy solution</h3>
        <p>An ad popped up. I normally hate ads. But this was different.</p>
  
        <p>It was an ad from the <b>Traffic Safety Institute about a DMV Mature Driver Course, here in California.</b></p>
  
        <p>I was skeptical and hesitant after all the disappointments but I clicked on it anyway.</p>
  
        <p><b>And I’m glad I did!</b></p>
  
        <p>To my biggest surprise, this course was <b>free to start</b>, and it was putting money back into your pocket because your car insurance will go down after completing it.</p>
  
        <p>I didn’t even take into account saving money before searching for mature driver courses, but this was quite an incentive.</p>
